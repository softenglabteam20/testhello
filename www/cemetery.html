	That's nice... of all the places I've ended up in the graveyard.</br>
	Many thoughts in your mind and goosebumps make your hair in your arms stand up while you walk through this necropolis. Under the dark sky, this silence
	like a white noise in my head.</br>
	The dirt is muddy and I dig dipper and dipper. The shovel heavy in my hands but I must continue. The name on the tombstone "Marie Laveau", year of birth
	1873, year of death 1919, but as I found earlier she had no relatives in New Orleans. I hear a hollow sound indicating I reached the coffin, to my
	socking surprise... it was empty. I stop to take a breath and the questions starting bombarding my head. Who was that woman I was talking too? Was
	she Marie Laveau? What's the connection to the Barrow case? Pieces of a puzzle I can't get together and...</br>
	Female voice: You think you 're losing it boy? (And a hand caressing slowly your hair.)</br>
	I almost got a heart attack and jumped up only to see "her" again!
