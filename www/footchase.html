	Tonight it's pretty cold outside. You can see your breath and after a few times it's like giving you a pace.</br>
	I feel I'm being followed from the time I left my house.</br>
	In the next corner you turn around quickly and you manage to see a person hiding behind a wall.</br>
	OK, now I am pretty sure someone is after me and I need to get the situation in my hands. Closing the distance between me and the person I noticed, I put
	my hand over my revolver... Almost at the corner and I hear footsteps running away.
