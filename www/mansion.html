	A long night has passed and with my "hunting" instincts ablaze after a deep hibernation, I find myself a few steps away from
	the main entrance of Jean's Barrow mansion.<br/>
	Two mugs of coffee and yet I can't get myself together.<br/>
	A two floor stone colonial house, I am not an art history expert but I think it's Victorian architecture. I bet, if I was a
	rich spoiled boy I would love every bit of it. The scenery is completed by a big garden full of flowers and trimmed bushes...
	My finger is already on the ring-bell.<br/>
	Detective: And now we wait.<br/>
	A middle age black man, well dressed even for a servant, opens the door and welcomes me. He escorts me towards the house and then
	inside the living room. We both walk all the way in a deep dead silence, walking in a slow pace, it's almost psychedelic.<br/>
	Butler: Wait here please. Mr. Barrow will be here shortly.<br/>
	I snap out of it, just staring at him without saying anything. That's when I realize that life hasn't been easy on him, maybe
	not even fair. He turns his back, walks away and I left alone waiting.<br/>
	I take a look around and see nothing more than expected. Complex curved furniture and expensive decorations and then, in front
	of me a collection of stuffed animals, somehow it gives me the chills. The voice of Jean Barrow behind me, surprises me.<br/>
	Jean Barrow: Good morning. I appreciate it that you are on your time. Let's not waste time then. I called you over so you can check
	on your own the death scene. Follow me please.<br/>
	You walk through a corridor. The noise of your footsteps are absorbed by the thick red carpet, almost muted. You feel that the silence
	in every part of this house is really strange. While reaching the end of the hallway a door awaits you and Jean Barrow gives his last
	instructions.<br/>
	Jean Barrow: Unfortunately, I can't stay any longer, I have to get ready for work, the factory has many responsibilities. Go on and check 
	my fathers office, the place he left his last breath. I hope we have progress very soon (slightly opens the door). Until next time.<br/>
	Detective: Have a good day Mr. Barrow.<br/>
	I close the door behind me, isolating myself from the rest of the house. A big wooden desk filled with papers and folders. Next to it, a small
	furniture with a radio on it and a couple half empty bottles of "liquid gold". To the other side, it's the library full of books, next to the
	window. All and all a tidy room, perfectly organized that makes you wonder if this room was a death scene.
