	The skies have opened up once again pouring heavy rain. A few steps away you recognize the figure of a car. That's a nice car you don't 
	see every day in this neighbourhood.<br/>
	The drivers' window lowers and a trembled voice speaks to you.<br/>
	Client: Ehm... you were late.<br/>
	Detective: With heavy rain it's not easy to go on foot.<br/>
	Client: Anyway... I told you on the phone, I think it was a murder!<br/>
	Detective: It was all over the press this morning. He was your father. Am I right Mr. Jean Barrow?<br/>
	Jean Barrow: Yes, yes... You have to learn what really happened. I don't trust the police saying it was suicide<br/>
	The hand of the young man with a stuffed envelope comes out of the window.<br/>
	Jean Barrow: Take this money in advance. Tomorrow at 9 a.m. we meet in my mansion? St. Charles Avenue 12, Garden District. Well
	as you already know, discretion is the key and lets say it's better to avoid visiting the factory. It's best we avoid being seen together
	as much as possible.<br/>
	As you grasp the envelope you slightly nod and within a few seconds you are alone looking the gloomy sky, thinking your next move.
